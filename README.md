Project Description: Advertising Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview:
This project aims to build a predictive model to understand how advertising spending (on TV, Radio, and Newspapers) impacts sales. The model will use linear regression to analyze historical advertising data and predict future sales based on advertising budgets.

Dataset:
The dataset (advertising.csv) contains information about advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and their corresponding sales figures (in thousands of units). Each row represents a snapshot of advertising spend and resulting sales figures for a given period (e.g., a week, month).

Project Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset into memory using Pandas.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and basic statistics.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately if necessary.
Data Visualization:

Visualize the distributions of advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales using box plots and histograms.
Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots and pair plots to understand potential correlations.
Data Preprocessing:

Prepare the data for modeling by splitting into predictor variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and target variable (Sales).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Building:

Implement linear regression using libraries such as statsmodels or scikit-learn.
Fit the model using the training data and evaluate its coefficients, intercept, and statistical significance.
Visualize the regression line along with the scatter plot of the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Predict sales using the test data and evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
Interpret the results to understand how well the model predicts sales based on advertising budgets.
Plot the predicted values against the actual values to visualize model accuracy.
Conclusion and Deployment:

Summarize findings from the model and discuss insights into how different advertising channels influence sales.
Consider potential improvements or additional features that could enhance model accuracy.
Prepare the model for deployment in a production environment if applicable.
Tools and Technologies:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE for interactive development and visualization.
Expected Outcome:
The primary outcome of this project is a well-performing linear regression model that accurately predicts sales based on advertising expenditures. Insights gained from the model can inform future advertising strategies, helping businesses allocate budgets more effectively to maximize sales.
